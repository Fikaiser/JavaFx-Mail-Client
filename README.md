# JavaFx Mail Client
A mock mail client made in Java. The UI was made in JavaFx.
Allows the user to send and recieve "email" messages linked to their email address.
All the user data and email messages are stored in a Microsoft SQL database. 
The app was made for a Java development class in college so some unusual features were added to cover course requirements.
The app stores contact lists in serialized (.ser) files and keeps it's configuration data in XML files. 
The emails are sent to a TCP server which then uploads them into the database. 
The app also has a chat functionality which was implemented using a RMI server.
